#### Changer for November 8 - November 22, 2024

- Added a folder with 10,000 test NFT icons.
- Fixed the display issues of some images on the frontend.
- Integrated MetaMask wallet for seamless transaction handling.
- Finalized QA documentation, including test plans for Functional Testing (User Registration, NFT Creation and Minting, Listing, Payment Integration, and Buying/Selling). The documentation covers objectives, scope, test cases, and criteria for pass/fail and bug reporting.
- Created a new model for spam classification, including an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase to analyze data patterns. The model also includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation steps for improved classification accuracy.
- Conducted model validation using cross-validation techniques and fine-tuned hyperparameters to ensure optimal performance across various datasets.

#### Changes for October 23 - November 7, 2024

- Hyperparameter Optimization: Using grid search and random search for hyperparameter tuning in situations where a more exhaustive search was needed.

- Analysis of the NFT Market on Different Networks: Read articles about the characteristics of NFTs on different blockchains (Polygon, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, etc.) to understand their pros and cons. 

- Article on Smart Contract Security: Security is crucial in smart contract development. Go through Consensys: Smart Contract Security Best Practices to better understand how to protect your contracts from potential vulnerabilities.

- Implemented error handling for API response issues, including missing data and malformed JSON, through validation and testing.

- Secured the API key by storing it in the appSettings.json file after resolving initial configuration challenges.

- Applied asynchronous programming to ensure smooth data fetching and UI updates, keeping the application responsive while waiting for API data.

#### Changes for October 7 - October 19, 2024

- Big Data Integration: We have successfully integrated Hadoop as the new backend storage solution. This update improves the scalability and performance of data processing tasks, making it easier to manage and analyze big data workloads.

- Cloud Deployment: The application has been fully migrated to AWS cloud infrastructure.

- Documentation on EIP-1155: EIP-1155 is a multi-token standard that can be useful for NFT projects. Read the EIP-1155 documentation to understand how to leverage this standard for enhancing functionality and optimizing storage. 

- Setup: Obtained the necessary API key after overcoming initial registration challenges, with support from teammates.

- Integrated the OpenSea API into the ASP.NET Core application using RestSharp to fetch NFT data.

- Implemented error handling for invalid or missing data to ensure the application handled API failures gracefully.

- Formatted and displayed the response data in a user-friendly format using Razor Pages, showcasing key metrics like sales volume, average price, and number of owners.
